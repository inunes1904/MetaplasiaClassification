# MetaplasiaClassification

### Objective
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the accurate classification of metaplasia in endoscopy images. By using advanced convolutional neural networks and transfer learning techniques, the aim is to provide healthcare professionals with an efficient and accurate tool for the early detection of metaplastic changes in gastrointestinal tissues. The project seeks to increase diagnostic accuracy, simplify endoscopic examinations and contribute to early intervention in gastrointestinal diseases. Ultimately, the implementation of this technology aims to advance gastroenterological healthcare by introducing state-of-the-art image analysis and classification capabilities.
